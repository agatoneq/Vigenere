# Vigenere

## Description
This is my first project ever! 
This project is a command-line application written in C++ that performs encryption, decryption, and key-breaking for the Vigenere cipher. It reads input from files, processes the data based on the provided mode, and outputs the results to a specified file.
<br><br>

## Features
### Encryption:
Encrypts text using the Vigenere cipher with a provided key.

### Decryption:
Decrypts text using the Vigenere cipher with a provided key.

### Key Breaking:
Attempts to break the Vigenere cipher without knowing the key by analyzing the frequency of letters in the ciphertext.

### File I/O:
Reads input from a specified file and writes output to a specified file.
